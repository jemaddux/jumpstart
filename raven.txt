And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Filled me--thrilled me!--with fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance to my chamber door.
"Some late visitor entreating entrance to my chamber door.
"Only this, and nothing more."
